## Welcome To The Assorion Wiki Page

We will document the various complexities with making an FNF mod built on this engine.
This will give you the chance to tinker with the game's variables.

I will try and present this as a sandbox. Where instead of just telling you everything up front,
I'll show you how putting a mod together on this engine works.

Of course though, there will still be more plain documentation for those who need it.
I won't cover every little detail but will cover the variables and functions.
